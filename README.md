# DocTime
DOC-BASED APPOINTMENT System
Short description
The program creates daily folders for the next years in advance (run mappe.exe).

Documents you want to put on a date are simply dragged to the appropriate folder.

The program displays all daily folders and marks the folders with content. You can open Explorer or TotalCommander directly from the tag then and edit the documents/appointments.

TotalCommander

On the left side you see all day folders and on the right side the day is open.

The documents can then be easily edited, deleted and moved.



Functions and some extensions:
Double click - Open TotalCommander

Right mouse button - open Explorer

New function: You can now also enter a note or an appointment using the Appointment Note button.

For appointments with alarm function the file name must start with # and then the time in the format HH.MM
